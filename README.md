# Hi there üëã I'm Orhan Ozey

I'm a DevOps and Backend Developer specializing in security and working with frameworks like Laravel and Filament to build efficient solutions. I often work on open-source projects and freelance work, always focusing on creating secure and scalable applications.

I also enjoy writing about PHP, Laravel, and more. My goal is to help others streamline their development processes by sharing knowledge and experiences in these technologies.

Stay tuned for updates and insights!
